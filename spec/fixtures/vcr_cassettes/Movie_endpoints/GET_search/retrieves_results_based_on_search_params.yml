        of the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, in an attempt to
        understand the work''s phenomenal success and influence. The program looks
        for answers in the author''s sources of inspiration, from the folk legends
        of Norway to the field of linguistics of which Tolkien was a lifelong student.
        It finds that the deep chord the story strikes owes its resonance to the author''s
        use of archetypal imagery and language. Many examples of these recurrent themes
        and images are given, with readings from the work and other literature. Interviews
        with the book''s illustrators, the brothers Hildebrandt, speak to the power
        of the imagery in the classic story. Scholars, Tolkien''s children, and the
        author himself provide insight into the mythic themes and the spell they have
        cast over the vast readership of The Lord of the Rings.","popularity":1.882,"poster_path":"/7fzIaIcpj4f0O3IHE65qGqlNcuL.jpg","release_date":"2001-12-04","title":"Master
